**Academic Projects**

**Wounds Analysis Mobile App Backend - WPI**

* Re-architected backend infrastructure for a machine learning-based medical analysis application to improve reliability and performance
* Migrated legacy MongoDB instance to a relational SQL database and refactored maintenance scripts for better maintainability
* Replaced Flask with FastAPI on AWS EC2, implementing OpenAPI specifications for automated documentation and endpoint testing
* Optimized deployment by converting PyTorch models (CNN, MLP) to ONNX format, enabling cross-platform compatibility
* Reduced monthly AWS operational costs by several hundred dollars through resource optimization and architectural streamlining

**WebGL Vector Graphics Editor - WPI**

* Developed a high-performance JavaScript/WebGL application for the real-time rendering and manipulation of SVG files
* Implemented complex affine transformation matrices to handle object rotation, scaling, and translation within the GPU pipeline
* Engineered a coordinate transformation system to bridge screen space, world space, and normalized device coordinates (NDC)
* Built an interactive UI supporting real-time viewport transformations and dynamic shape editing

**Unix/Linux Shell Implementation - WPI**

* Engineered a custom command-line shell in C featuring support for pipes, I/O redirection, and background job management
* Implemented low-level process control using `fork()`, `exec()`, and `waitpid()` system calls
* Developed a robust signal handling system to manage asynchronous process interrupts and terminal control
* Added support for environment variable expansion and basic shell scripting control flow

**Multi-threaded Raytracer - WPI**

* Parallelized a C-based raytracing engine using POSIX threads to maximize CPU utilization during high-fidelity rendering
* Implemented a double-buffering strategy to eliminate I/O bottlenecks and overlap computation with frame output
* Managed thread synchronization and resource contention using semaphores and mutexes for physics-heavy calculations
* Achieved significant performance gains by optimizing memory access patterns and minimizing thread overhead

**CPU Scheduler Simulator - WPI**

* Programmed a comprehensive process scheduler simulation in C to evaluate various CPU dispatching algorithms
* Implemented FIFO, Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin, and Multi-level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduling logic
* Developed analytical tools to calculate and visualize metrics for response time, turnaround time, and wait time per process
* Validated scheduler efficiency across diverse workloads to simulate real-world multitasking environments
